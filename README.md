# Data-Visualization
Geo-spatial Visual of fortune 100 in the US
Using the original fortune 500 dataset combined with zipcode package from CRAN, mapping analysis can be conducted to visualize the geographical distribution for companies and sectors of interest. 
Getting rid of unnecessary columns including zip, website, non-quantifiable location labels, and redundant industry datas can make the dataset looks cleaner for more concise and detailed analysis. 
The circular is very porportional and self explanatory, so it can incorporate other financial metrics within in a stacked format in final visualization.
